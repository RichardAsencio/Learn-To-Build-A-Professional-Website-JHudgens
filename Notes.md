    - titles
    - animations (to accomplish this with JavaScript)

4. build the About Me page

TIPS:

1. When tackling a project like this, doing this type of todo list will help by giving me 
structure
2. this allows me to define clearly the structure of the project and what i need to do  
3. As I go thru the project I can later add, annotate or pin more detailed specs or ideas 
on these notes so that I can later refer to them as go on 
4. breaking the project into different steps allows me not to procrastinate or get paralized 
by the size of the project, because as I break it down into smaller pieces I can start working 
on a single small piece without being worried about the larger project overall. Taking big 
tasks and breaking them into smaller tasks makes the job easier to work in and to focus at 
one thing at a time


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
1. Set up the project and add the general folder/file structure 

- created a repo on GitHub, then cloned it in my local machine (this is my project container)

- from the Terminal I go to my project repo as my pwd and open the text editor from there

- here I see my new README file, so I edit it and also create a NOTE md files, and edit them 
respectively

- now that I am inside my project repo (container) I now create a directory named: "portfolio-html-site". 
This directory will hold my projects folders, files and any other images, resources or assets 
Note: the README and Notes .md files will reamin outside this project folder for now ...

- inside the "portfolio-html-site" folder create two html files: index.html and about.html

- I type some heading text on both pages and "Live Server" them just to make sure they area working ok. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Lets start with the Styling part

- created a link and a stylesheet for it 

- now create two or more style rules for the html docs and "Live Server" them to make sure the css link is ok and we can now start working adding style and content to the project documents

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Images 

- create a folder within the project folder called images. This will hold the project images.
