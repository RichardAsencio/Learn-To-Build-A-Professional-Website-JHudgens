# Notes on the project as I go on 

TODO's 

1. Build the project 
    - creating the folder structure 
    - adding files
    - connecting files

2. build the Nav bar 
    - with two links and a name

* The homepage of this website has sort of like a grid type of presentation 
where the elements images are positioned on rows of three buy columns of 
four elements, and it will use: *

3. build the portfolio item grid
    - adding files
    - images 
    - titles
    - animations (to accomplish this with JavaScript)

4. build the About Me page
    - image 
    - split column layout
    - content

TIPS:

1. When tackling a project like this, doing this type of todo list will help by giving me structure
2. this allows me to define clearly the structure of the project and what i need to do  
3. As I go thru the project I can later add, annotate or pin more detailed specs or ideas on these notes 
so that I can later refer to them as go on 
4. breaking the project into different steps allows me not to procrastinate or get paralized by the size of the project, 
because as I break it down into smaller pieces I can start working on a single small piece without being worried 
about the larger project overall. Taking big tasks and breaking them into smaller tasks makes the job easier to work 
in and to focus at one thing at a time
